# Airtable next-auth adapter example

This is a next js app that shows how to use Airtable as a user database using [next-auth-adapter-airtable](https://github.com/kyen99/next-auth-adapter-airtable).

The providers in the example are Google and Email because that's what I used to test the adapter.

If you find a provider that doesn't work, please open an issue in the [next-auth-adapter-airtable repo](https://github.com/kyen99/next-auth-adapter-airtable) and include your `[...nextauth].js` file.
